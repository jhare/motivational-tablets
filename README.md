motivational-tablets
====================

Distributed web app for tablets displaying OO and SOLID principles.

More specifically, we have a set of posters around the office that explain elements of SOLID and other best practices. They're basic posters in frames in the hallways and at the pairing stations.

What I'd like to do is develop software to rotate these sayings and provide an interface to swipe through additional entries, or dig deeper into the subject. Perhaps buttons that expand to show an example or provide links for more sources.

Then one could load this up into a set of mounted tablets around the office. That way you're not staring at the same principle all of the time. It would reduce clutter as well as look pretty slick.
